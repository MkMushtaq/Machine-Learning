This is a Python that reads in two crisp inputs x1 and x2, and generates a crisp output y. In the real world of 
the Breakout Detection System, the two inputs correspond to the temperature slope, and the temperature rise, at any given instant of the process. 
The output is the value of Breakoutability.
